It's been 6 years, Instagram has challenged us a lots with their *public* api.

With a ton of work to implement bullshit Instagram app develop program with OAuth stuff (the same shit happen in Facebook too).

All we want is making a curl request and the data must be present in response data. That's all.

It's a time to get rid of this stupid issue.

Instagram SDK (C# - I'm no longer maintain):

Source code:

Docker image (updating soon):

I know this war will never end. And the win side is always Instagram, but I'll try my best to fight back.
